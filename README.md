# ðŸ¦… Falcon

Chrome extension for flexible full text browsing history search. **Press `f`, then `space`, in the omnibar to start searching your previously visited websites**! 

Every time you visit a website in Firefox, Falcon indexes all the text on the page so that the site can be easily found later. Then, for example, if you type `f <space> mugwort`, Falcon will show the websites you visited containing the text "mugwort"! [Install from the Firefox Add-ons here](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/falcon_extension/) or [get the XPI file](https://github.com/CennoxX/falcon/releases/tag/0.3.0)! (If you don't feel comfortable with that, look at [Transparent Installation](#transparent-installation)). Programmed by [@andrewilyas](https://github.com/andrewilyas), [@lengstrom](https://github.com/lengstrom) and [@CennoxX](https://github.com/cennoxx), art by [Lucia Liu](http://lucialiu.me).

## Transparent Installation
If you don't feel comfortable installing a Firefox extension that can read and modify all data on the websites you visit from the webstore (we wouldn't either!), you can clone it on your local machine, read through our code to verify that it is not malicious, and sign it at addons.mozilla.org and install it. This way you also won't receive any automatic updates, as well. 

## Preferences Page
To manage which URLs Falcon can index, delete websites from the index, and more, go to the preferences page.

## FAQ
### Will this index my bank statements?
Nope! We have a blacklist of domains to avoid indexing that includes the majority of banking websites. You can edit them and add your own in the preferences page! If you accidentally visit a page that is indexed that you don't want indexed, you can go into preferences and delete it from your indexed pages. 

### Do you store any information remotely?
No, all information is stored locally! No data leaves your computer over the network.
